# dev notes

20240218 - just finished the login/register page. The login page will return a session variable/prop which will get passed to an auth context which will get passed to the layout as an AuthProvider/AuthUser, which will wrap the core app

that's a lot of work but you can borrow heavily from the manifold markets repo

other steps before release

- [ ] SMTP server
- [ ] extension login 
- [ ] production setup

## onboarding stuff

### overview page
- [ ] tall SVG arrow 
- [ ] Chrome extensions svg
